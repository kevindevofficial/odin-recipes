    <h3>This is a very popular hispanic dish named "Chivo Guisado" which translates to 
        a curried goat meat dish!!
    </h3>
    <p>Goat meat has a stronger, gamier flavor than beef or pork, so it may be an acquired taste for some people and goes very well with white rice and some dominican beans to compliment!
    </p>
    <p>It is a staple in many dominican households for a long time due to its rich and unique flavor thats definately a must try!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 limes, or 1 bitter orange cut into halves</li>
        <li>4 pound bone-in goat meat, [1.8 kg] --or 2 lb [0.9 kg] of boneless meat-- cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons oregano (dry, ground)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon mashed garlic</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt, (or more, to taste)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cubanela (cubanelle pepper), chopped</li>
        <li>4 plum tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine, or a ¼ cup of rum (optional, see notes)</li>
        <li>½ scotch bonnet pepper, (or 2 habaneros) finely chopped</li>
        <li>Parsley, or cilantro to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Rinsing meat:</strong> Add the juice of the limes (or bitter oranges on the meat). Stir to coat all the meat. Let it rest for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>Once the 15 minutes have passed, take the meat out of the liquids, and discard the liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning meat:</strong> Add the onion, oregano, garlic, and a teaspoon of salt. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Marinate covered in the fridge for an hour, overnight is better.</li>
        <li><strong>Browning meat:</strong> Heat the oil in a deep-bottomed pot over high heat. Add just the meat to the oil (set aside onions and juices released by the meat in the marinade).</li>
        <li>The meat will release some liquid when heated, cook and stir until all the liquid has evaporated, and the meat is browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmering:</strong> Add 2 tablespoons of water, lower heat to medium-low, stir and cover.</li>
        <li>Every 5 minutes add water and stir, cover again and repeat until the meat is very tender (30 to 60 minutes, depending on the quality of the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding vegetables:</strong> Once the meat is tender add the onions (and meat juices), tomato, and cubanela.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer until the vegetables are cooked-through (5 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Making sauce:</strong> Pour in the tomato sauce, stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add wine and 1½ cups of water. Simmer and reduce to a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste if you find it necessary and simmer until liquid is reduced to a thin sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Decorate with parsley or cilantro leaves.</li>
    </ol>
