        <li>Soak overnight, drain liquid and beans are ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Add water (10 cups) cover and seal the pressure cooker (or Instant Pot) over medium heat, when the pot comes to pressure cook high pressure 20 minutes. Natural release.</li>
        <li>While the pressure releases, in a large skillet, heat oil over medium-low heat and add garlic, tomato paste, cilantro, red onion, pepper, bouillon cube and saute about 10 minutes, stirring.</li>
        <li>Open the pressure cooker when the steam releases, take 25% of the beans and liquid and transfer to the blender. Puree well then return to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add adobo seasoning and salt (about 1 teaspoon), or to taste.</li>
        <li> Add the sauteed vegetables to the beans and bring to a boil over medium heat. (In the Instant Pot use the saute button.)</li>
        <li>Boil uncovered over medium-low heat until the texture becomes creamy and the liquid reduces, about 30 minutes stirring often. </li>
        <li>Remove cilantro, pepper and onion and serve over rice and even by itself, enjoy!</li>
